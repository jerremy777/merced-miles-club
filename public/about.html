        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>
            Merced Miles Club is centered around running around Lake Merced in San Francisco
            in the counter-clockwise direction. The route is fixed and does not change.
        </p>

        <p>
            People participate in different ways. Some run the loop occasionally, while others
            return to it over longer periods of time. There is no expected pace and no timeline
            for completion.
        </p>

        <p>
            The club does not organize group runs or maintain schedules. There are no rankings,
            and participation is generally individual.
        </p>

        <p>
            Membership is informal. If you run around Lake Merced counter-clockwise, you are
            participating.
