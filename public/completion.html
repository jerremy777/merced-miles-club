        <p>
            When a 100 Laps Challenge Card is fully completed,
            you may mail it to us.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is one reward per completed card.
        </p>

        <p>
            We do not verify your laps.<br>
            We do not track your pace.<br>
            We do not keep records.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mailing the card is optional.
        </p>

        <p>
            Keeping it and telling no one also counts.
        </p>
