        <p>
            Merced Miles Club is centered around running around Lake Merced in San Francisco
            in the counter-clockwise direction.
        </p>

        <p>
            The club does not organize scheduled runs or events. Participation is informal
            and generally individual.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anyone may consider themselves part of the club.
        </p>

        <h2>The Loop</h2>

        <p>
            Lake Merced is approximately 4 miles around. A single lap consists of one
            counter-clockwise loop.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each completed loop counts as one lap.
        </p>

        <h2>The 100 Laps Challenge</h2>

        <p>
            The 100 Laps Challenge is an optional long-term challenge associated with the club.
        </p>

        <p>
            Completing 100 counter-clockwise laps around Lake Merced is roughly equivalent
            to running 400 miles over time.
        </p>

        <p>
            The challenge may be completed at any pace and over any length of time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Progress may be tracked using a 100 Laps Challenge Card.
